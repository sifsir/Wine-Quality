# Wine-Quality

Name: Sifra Siregar

## Objective
> Develop a machine learning framework that not only classifies wines into their respective white or red categories but also elucidates the influence of physicochemical properties on the quality of the wines, thereby providing educational insights for consumers.

>  Utilize the best-performing model to generate model inferences by creating representative dummy data.

## Dataset
Kaggle - Wine Quality, comprises 64967 samples with 11-12 physicochemical predictors and a sensory quality rating, used for predicting or classifying wine quality through machine learning [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality)
